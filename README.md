# Marathon Vault plugin [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/avast/marathon-vault-plugin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/avast/marathon-vault-plugin) [![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/avast/maven/marathon-vault-plugin/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/avast/maven/marathon-vault-plugin/_latestVersion)

Plugin for [Marathon](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/) which injects secrets stored in [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) via environment variables.

## How to reference secrets in marathon.json

The following example `marathon.json` fragment will read Vault path `/secret/abc/xyz`, extract field `password` from that path and inject the field value into an environment variable named `ENV_NAME`:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "ENV_NAME": {
      "secret": "secret_ref"
    }
  },
  "secrets": {
    "secret_ref": {
      "source": "/secret/abc/xyz@password"
    }
  }
}
```

If the provided Vault path or field is not found, the environment variable will not be set. The same applies when it cannot be read because of permissions or other types of errors. Either way, it will be logged as an error in Marathon logs.

## Installation

Please consult the [Start Marathon with plugins](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/plugin.html#start-marathon-with-plugins) section of the official docs for a general overview of how plugins are enabled.

The plugin configuration JSON file will need to reference the Vault plugin as follows:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "envVarExtender": {
      "plugin": "mesosphere.marathon.plugin.task.RunSpecTaskProcessor",
      "implementation": "com.avast.marathon.plugin.vault.VaultPlugin",
      "configuration": {
        "address": "http://address_to_your_vault_instance:port",
        "token": "access_token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You will also need to start Marathon with the secrets feature being enabled. See [Marathon command line flags](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/command-line-flags) for more details. In short, it can be enabled by
* specifying `--enable_features secrets` in Marathon command line
* specifying environment variable `MARATHON_ENABLE_FEATURES=secrets` when starting Marathon
